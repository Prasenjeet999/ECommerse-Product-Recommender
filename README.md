# E-commerce Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive product recommendation system for e-commerce platforms using various machine learning techniques. The system aims to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchase history, as well as overall product popularity.

## Key Features
- Rank-based product recommendations
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Model-based collaborative filtering using SVD
- Handling of cold start problems

## Notebooks
1. `rank_based_product_recommendation.ipynb`: Implements popularity-based recommendations.
2. `User_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb`: Demonstrates user-based collaborative filtering techniques.
3. `Model_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb`: Explores model-based collaborative filtering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

## Dataset
The project uses an Amazon dataset on user ratings for electronic products. Each product and user is assigned a unique identifier to maintain privacy and avoid biases.

Dataset source: [Amazon Electronics Rating Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vibivij/amazon-electronics-rating-datasetrecommendation/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)

## Approaches
1. **Rank-Based Recommendation**: Recommends popular products based on the number of ratings.
2. **Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Provides personalized recommendations based on similar users' interactions.
3. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Uses SVD for dimensionality reduction and predicts user-item interactions.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of rating predictions.

## Usage
To explore this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies (list them if applicable)
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the order mentioned above

## Future Work
- Implement content-based filtering
- Explore hybrid recommendation systems
- Enhance scalability for large datasets

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the recommendation system or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for discussion.
